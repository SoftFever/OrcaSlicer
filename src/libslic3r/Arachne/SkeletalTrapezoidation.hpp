/*!
 * Main class of the dynamic beading strategies.
 *
 * The input polygon region is decomposed into trapezoids and represented as a half-edge data-structure.
 *
 * We determine which edges are 'central' accordinding to the transitioning_angle of the beading strategy,
 * and determine the bead count for these central regions and apply them outward when generating toolpaths. [oversimplified]
 *
 * The method can be visually explained as generating the 3D union of cones surface on the outline polygons,
 * and changing the heights along central regions of that surface so that they are flat.
 * For more info, please consult the paper "A framework for adaptive width control of dense contour-parallel toolpaths in fused
deposition modeling" by Kuipers et al.
 * This visual explanation aid explains the use of "upward", "lower" etc,
 * i.e. the radial distance and/or the bead count are used as heights of this visualization, there is no coordinate called 'Z'.
 *
 * TODO: split this class into two:
 * 1. Class for generating the decomposition and aux functions for performing updates
 * 2. Class for editing the structure for our purposes.
