# THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS DATA FOR HINTS NOTIFICATIONS
#
# Each notification is divided by 
# [hint:*name of notification*]
#
# Each notification MUST have text var in format:
# text = Headline of hint\nBody of hint.
# Headline is divided by new line (\n) from body.
# Headline is automaticaly printed as Bold.
# Body can contain bold marks: <b>text to be bold</b> (currently rendered as different color, not bold due to font limitations)
# Body can contain hypertext: <a>hypertext text</a>
# Hypertext must be max one per notification and must be closed by </a>
#
# Notification can have documentation link
#
# If notification contains hypertext, it needs to be specified by hypertext_type var.
# each type needs to be supported with one or more additional vars.
# These types are possible:
#
# Settings highlight (like search feature)
# hypertext_type = settings
# hypertext_settings_opt = name_of_settings (hover over settings value and copy last line of hover text)
# hypertext_settings_type = 1 (1 - 5 according to settings tab - to be channged to name of tabs instead of numbers)
# hypertext_settings_category = Infill (name of panel - written on left in settings)
#
# Plater top toolbar highlight
# hypertext_type = plater
# hypertext_plater_item = nameofbutton (internal name of GLToolbar items)
# 
# Plater gizmos (left) toolbar highlight
# hypertext_type = gizmo
# hypertext_gizmo_item = name (name of svg icon of gizmo in resources without .svg suffix)
#
# Open preferences (might add item to highlight)
# hypertext_type = preferences
# hypertext_preferences_page = name of the prefernces tab
# hypertext_preferences_item = show_collapse_button (name of variable saved in prusaslicer.ini connected to the setting in preferences)
#
# Open gallery (no aditional var)
# hypertext_type = gallery
#
#Open top menubar item 
#hypertext_menubar_menu_name =  (Name in english visible as menu name: File, )
#hypertext_menubar_item_name =  (Name of item in english, if there are three dots at the end of name, put name without three dots)
#
#
# Each notification can have disabled and enabled modes and techs - divided by ; and space 
# enabled_tags = ...
# disabled_tags = ...
# supported tags are: simple; advanced; expert; FFF; MMU; SLA; Windows; Linux; OSX;
# and all filament types:  PLA; PET; ABS; ASA; FLEX; HIPS; EDGE; NGEN; NYLON; PVA; PC; PP; PEI; PEEK; PEKK; POM; PSU; PVDF; SCAFF; 
# Tags are case sensitive. 
# FFF is affirmative for both one or more extruder printers.
# Algorithm shows hint only if ALL enabled tags are affirmative. (so never do enabled_tags = FFF; SLA;)
# Algorithm shows hint only if not in all disabled tags.
# if there are both disabled and preferred, only preferred that are not in disabled are valid.
#
#
# Notifications shows in random order, already shown notifications are saved at cache/hints.cereal (as binary - human non-readable)
# You can affect random ordering by seting weigh
# weight = 5
# Weight must be larger or equal to 1. Default weight is 1.
# Weight defines probability as weight : sum_of_all_weights.
