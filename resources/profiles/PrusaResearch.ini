# The printer models will be shown by the Configuration Wizard in this order,
# also the first model installed & the first nozzle installed will be activated after install.
#TODO: One day we may differentiate variants of the nozzles / hot ends,
#for example by the melt zone size, or whether the nozzle is hardened.
# Printer model name will be shown by the installation wizard.
