        Please be sure to add the following files:
          * Please upload a ZIP archive containing the **project file** used when the problem arise. Please export it just before or after the problem occurs. Even if you did nothing and/or there is no object, export it! (We need the configurations in project file).
            You can export the project file from the application menu in `File`->`Save project as...`, then zip it
          * A **log file** for crashes and similar issues.
            You can find your log file here:
            Windows: `%APPDATA%\OrcaSlicer\log` or usually `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\OrcaSlicer\log`
            MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/OrcaSlicer/log`
            Linux: `$HOME/.config/OrcaSlicer/log`
            If Orca Slicer still starts, you can also reach this directory from the application menu in `Help` -> `Show Configuration Folder`
            You can zip the log directory, or just select the newest logs when this issue happens, and zip them
