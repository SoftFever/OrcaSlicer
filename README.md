**Welcome to JusPrin, the first GenAI app for 3D printing!**

Brought to you by the creator of [The Spaghetti Detective](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/), JusPrin aims to revolutionize the 3D printing experience by eliminating the need for manual slicing. Imagine: **no confusing slicing parameters, no headaches over printing issues caused by incorrect settings. Just print.** That's the promise of JusPrin.

## Why JusPrin?

3D printing enthusiasts have relied on slicing tools to prepare models, often struggling with complex parameters and trial-and-error setups. JusPrin changes all of that by leveraging Generative AI to automatically select and optimize slicing settings based on your requirements. Itâ€™s designed to:

- **Eliminate Complexity**: No need to tweak dozens of parameters. JusPrinâ€™s AI takes care of it.
- **Reduce Printing Issues**: By intelligently choosing settings, JusPrin minimizes common print failures and errors.
- **Unlock Creative Solutions**: JusPrin sometimes surprises even us with creative combinations of slicing settings, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in 3D printing.

This is a beta version, and while itâ€™s not perfect yet, itâ€™s already showing exciting potential. JusPrin is available for **Windows** and **Mac**. Linux support is coming soon.

## Download
