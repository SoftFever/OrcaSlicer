# Filament Tolerance Calibration

Every filament/printer quality setting combination has a different tolerance. This means that the same filament can have different tolerances on different printers. The tolerance test is designed to help you find the best tolerance for your printer and filament combination.

## Orca Tolerance Test
This tolerance test is specifically designed to assess the dimensional accuracy of your printer and filament. The model comprises a base and a hexagon tester. The base contains six hexagon hole, each with a different tolerance: 0.0mm, 0.05mm, 0.1mm, 0.2mm, 0.3mm, and 0.4mm. The dimensions of the hexagon tester are illustrated in the image.

You can assess the tolerance using either an M6 Allen key or the printed hexagon tester.
