## Sparse infill density

Density usually should be calculated as a % of the total infill volume, not the total print volume.
Higher density increases strength but also material usage and print time. Lower density saves material and time but reduces strength.

Nevertheless, **not all patterns interpret density the same way**, so the actual material usage may vary. You can see each pattern's material usage in the [Sparse Infill Pattern](#sparse-infill-pattern) section.

## Fill Multiline

This setting allows you to generate your selected [infill pattern](#sparse-infill-pattern) using multiple parallel lines while preserving both the defined [infill density](#sparse-infill-density) and the overall material usage.

> [!NOTE]
> Orca's approach is different from other slicers that simply multiply the number of lines and material usage, generating a denser infill than expected.

### Use cases

- Increasing the number of lines (e.g., 2 or 3) can improve part strength and print speed without increasing material usage.
- Fire-retardant applications: Some flame-resistant materials (like PolyMax PC-FR) require a minimum printed wall/infill thickness—often 1.5–3 mm—to comply with standards. Since infill contributes to overall part thickness, using multiple lines helps achieve the necessary thickness without switching to a large nozzle or printing with 100% infill. This is especially useful for high-temperature materials like PC, which are prone to warping when fully solid.
- Creating aesthetically pleasing infill patterns (like [Grid](#grid) or [Honeycomb](#honeycomb)) with multiple line widths—without relying on CAD modeling or being limited to a single extrusion width.

> [!WARNING]
> For self intersecting infills (e.g. [Cubic](#cubic), [Grid](#grid)) multiline count greater than 3 may cause layer shift, extruder clog or other issues due to overlapping of lines on intersection points.

## Direction and Rotation

### Direction

Controls the direction of the infill lines to optimize or strengthen the print.

### Rotation

This parameter adds a rotation to the sparse infill direction for each layer according to the specified template. The template is a comma-separated list of angles in degrees.

For example:

```c++
0,90
```

The first layer uses 0°, the second uses 90°, and the pattern repeats for subsequent layers.

Other examples:

```c++
0,45,90
```

```c++
0,60,120,180
```

If there are more layers than angles, the sequence repeats.
> [!NOTE]
> Not all sparse infill patterns support rotation.

## Infill Wall Overlap

Infill area is enlarged slightly to overlap with wall for better bonding. The percentage value is relative to line width of sparse infill. Set this value to ~10-15% to minimize potential over extrusion and accumulation of material resulting in rough surfaces.

- **Infill Wall Overlap On**

![InfillWallOverlapOn](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/blob/main/doc/images/fill/InfillWallOverlapOn.svg?raw=true)

## Apply gap fill

Enables gap fill for the selected solid surfaces. The minimum gap length that will be filled can be controlled from the filter out tiny gaps option.

1. **Everywhere:** Applies gap fill to top, bottom and internal solid surfaces for maximum strength.
2. **Top and Bottom surfaces:** Applies gap fill to top and bottom surfaces only, balancing print speed, reducing potential over extrusion in the solid infill and making sure the top and bottom surfaces have no pinhole gaps.
3. **Nowhere:** Disables gap fill for all solid infill areas.

Note that if using the [classic perimeter generator](quality_settings_wall_generator#classic), gap fill may also be generated between perimeters, if a full width line cannot fit between them.
That perimeter gap fill is not controlled by this setting.

If you would like all gap fill, including the classic perimeter generated one, removed, set the filter out tiny gaps value to a large number, like 999999.

However this is not advised, as gap fill between perimeters is contributing to the model's strength. For models where excessive gap fill is generated between perimeters, a better option would be to switch to the [arachne wall generator](quality_settings_wall_generator#arachne) and use this option to control whether the cosmetic top and bottom surface gap fill is generated.

## Anchor

Connect an infill line to an internal perimeter with a short segment of an additional perimeter. If expressed as percentage (example: 15%) it is calculated over infill extrusion width.
OrcaSlicer tries to connect two close infill lines to a short perimeter segment. If no such perimeter segment shorter than this parameter is found, the infill line is connected to a perimeter segment at just one side and the length of the perimeter segment taken is limited to infill_anchor, but no longer than this parameter. If set to 0, the old algorithm for infill connection will be used, it should create the same result as with 1000 & 0.

- **Anchor Off**

## Internal Solid Infill

Line pattern of internal solid infill. If the [detect narrow internal solid infill](strength_settings_advanced#detect-narrow-internal-solid-infill) be enabled, the concentric pattern will be used for the small area.

## Sparse Infill Pattern

Infill patterns determine how material is distributed within a print. Different patterns can affect strength, flexibility, and print speed using the same density setting.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, as the best pattern depends on the specific print and its requirements.

Many patterns may look similar and have similar overall specifications, but they can behave very differently in practice.
As most settings in 3D printing, experience is the best way to determine which pattern works best for your specific needs.

### Hilbert Curve

Hilbert Curve is a space-filling curve that can be used to create a continuous infill pattern. It is known for its Esthetic appeal and ability to fill space efficiently.

### Quarter Cubic

[Cubic](#cubic) pattern with extra internal divisions, improving X-Y strength.

- **Horizontal Strength (X-Y):** High
- **Vertical Strength (Z):** High
- **Density Calculation:**  % of  total infill volume
- **Material Usage:** Normal
- **Print Time:** Normal-Low
- **Material/Time (Higher better):** Normal

### Zig Zag

Similar to [rectilinear](#rectilinear) with consistent pattern between layers. Allows you to add a Symmetric infill Y axis for models with two symmetric parts.

- **Horizontal Strength (X-Y):** Normal-Low
- **Vertical Strength (Z):** Low
- **Density Calculation:**  % of  total infill volume
- **Material Usage:** Normal
- **Print Time:** Normal
- **Material/Time (Higher better):** Normal

### Cross Zag

Similar to [Zig Zag](#zig-zag) but displacing each layer with Infill shift step parameter.

- **Horizontal Strength (X-Y):** Normal
- **Vertical Strength (Z):** Low
- **Density Calculation:**  % of  total infill volume
- **Material Usage:** Normal
- **Print Time:** Normal
- **Material/Time (Higher better):** Normal

### Locked Zag

Adaptive version of [Zig Zag](#zig-zag) adding an external skin texture to interlock layers and a low material skeleton.

- **Horizontal Strength (X-Y):** Normal-Low
- **Vertical Strength (Z):** Normal-Low
- **Density Calculation:** Same as [Zig Zag](#zig-zag) but increasing near walls
- **Material Usage:** Normal-High
- **Print Time:** Extra-High
- **Material/Time (Higher better):** Low
