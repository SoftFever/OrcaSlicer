# Walls

In 3D printing, "walls" refer to the outer layers of a printed object that provide its shape and structural integrity. Adjusting wall settings can significantly affect the strength, appearance, and print time of your model.

## Wall loops

"Wall loops" refers to the number of times the outer wall is printed in a loop. Increasing the wall loops can improve the strength and durability of the print, but may also increase print time.

## Alternate extra wall

This setting adds an extra wall to every other layer. This way the infill gets wedged vertically between the walls, resulting in stronger prints.  
When this option is enabled, the ensure vertical shell thickness option needs to be disabled.  
Using lightning infill together with this option is not recommended as there is limited infill to anchor the extra perimeters to.

## Detect thin wall

Detect thin wall which can't contain two line width. And use single line to print. Maybe printed not very well, because it's not closed loop.
