# Layer Height

Layer height defines the vertical thickness of each printed layer, playing a crucial role in both print quality and printing speed.

Using smaller layer heights increases print time but results in:

- Smoother surface finishes
- Less noticeable layer lines
- Enhanced detail on curves
- [Better performance on overhangs](#layer-height-overhangs-impacts)

## Layer Height Guidelines

Usually, the optimal range for layer height is between 20% and 80% of the nozzle diameter.

- **Below 20%:** Flow inconsistencies and "fish scale" patterns may occur, especially at high speeds.
- **Over 80%:** Increased risk of layer adhesion issues and reduced print quality.

## First Layer Height

Controls the thickness of the initial layer.  
A thicker first layer improves bed adhesion and compensates for build surface imperfections.

**Recommended:** 0.25mm for 0.4mm nozzle (62.5% of nozzle diameter)  
**Maximum:** 65% of nozzle diameter

## Layer Height Overhangs Impacts

Layer height directly affects [overhang angle](quality_settings_overhangs#maximum-angle) capability and quality.

**Smaller layer heights** enable steeper overhangs by reducing the unsupported distance between layers, while **larger layer heights** increase this gap, leading to more sagging and requiring support material at shallower angles.
