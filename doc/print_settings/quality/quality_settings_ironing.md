# Ironing

Ironing is a process used to improve the surface finish of 3D prints by smoothing out the top layers. This is achieved by selectively melting the outermost layer of the print, allowing it to flow and fill in any gaps or imperfections.

## Type

This setting controls which layer being ironed.

## Pattern

The pattern that will be used when ironing.

## Flow

The amount of material to extrude during ironing. Relative to flow of normal layer height. Too high value results in overextrusion on the surface.

## Line spacing

The distance between the lines of ironing.

## Inset

The distance to keep from the edges. A value of 0 sets this to half of the nozzle diameter.

## Angle

The angle ironing is done at. A negative number disables this function and uses the default method.

## Speed

See [Speed settings for other layers](speed_settings_other_layers_speed#ironing-speed) for more information about ironing speed.
