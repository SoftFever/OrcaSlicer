# Acceleration

Acceleration in 3D printing is usually set on the printer's firmware settings.  
This setting will try to override the acceleration when [normal printing acceleration](#normal-printing) value is different than 0.  
Orca will limit the acceleration to not exceed the acceleration set in the Printer's Motion Ability settings.

## Normal printing

The default acceleration of both normal printing and travel.

> [!NOTE]
> If this value is set to 0, the acceleration will be set to the printer's default acceleration.

## Outer wall

Acceleration for [outer wall](speed_settings_walls#outer-wall) printing. This is usually set to a lower value than normal printing to ensure better quality.

## Inner wall

Acceleration for [inner wall](speed_settings_walls#inner-wall) printing. This is usually set to a higher value than outer wall printing to improve speed.

## Bridge

Acceleration of [bridges](speed_settings_overhang_speed#bridge-speed). If the value is expressed as a percentage (e.g. 50%), it will be calculated based on the outer wall acceleration.

## Sparse infill

Acceleration of [sparse infill](speed_settings_other_layers_speed#sparse-infill). If the value is expressed as a percentage (e.g. 100%), it will be calculated based on the default acceleration.

## Internal solid infill

Acceleration of [internal solid infill](speed_settings_other_layers_speed#internal-solid-infill). If the value is expressed as a percentage (e.g. 100%), it will be calculated based on the default acceleration.

## Initial layer

Acceleration of [initial layer](speed_settings_initial_layer_speed). Using a lower value can improve build plate adhesion.

## Top surface

Acceleration of [top surface infill](speed_settings_other_layers_speed#top-surface). Using a lower value may improve top surface quality.  
Recommended to use a similar value to the [outer wall acceleration](#outer-wall).

## Travel

Acceleration of [travel](speed_settings_travel) moves. This is usually set to a higher value than normal printing to reduce travel time.
