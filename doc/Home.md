# Welcome to the OrcaSlicer WIKI!

Orca slicer is a powerful open source slicer for FFF (FDM) 3D Printers. This wiki page aims to provide an detailed explanation of the slicer settings, how to get the most out of them as well as how to calibrate and setup your printer.

The Wiki is work in progress so bear with us while we get it up and running!

## Print Settings, Tips and Tricks (Work In Progress)

The below sections provide a detailed settings explanation as well as tips and tricks in setting these for optimal print results.

### Quality Settings

- [Layer Height Settings](quality_settings_layer_height)

## Printer Calibration

The [Calibration Guide](./print_settings/calibration/Calibration.md) takes you through the key calibration tests in Orca - flow rate, pressure advance, print temperature, retraction, tolerances, etc.

- [Flow Rate](print_settings/calibration/flow-rate-calib.md)
- [Pressure Advance](print_settings/calibration/pressure-advance-calib.md)
- [Temperature](print_settings/calibration/temp-calib.md)
- [Retraction](print_settings/calibration/retraction-calib.md)
- [Tolerance](print_settings/calibration/tolerance-calib.md)
- Advanced:
  - [Volumetric Speed](print_settings/calibration/volumetric-speed-calib.md)
  - [Adaptive Pressure Advance Guide](print_settings/calibration/adaptive-pressure-advance-calib.md)
  - [Input Shaping](print_settings/calibration/input-shaping-calib.md)
