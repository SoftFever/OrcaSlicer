Orca also support `curr_bed_type` variable in custom G-code.
For example, the following sample G-codes can detect the selected bed type and adjust the G-code offset accordingly for Klipper:

```c++
{if curr_bed_type=="Textured PEI Plate"}
  SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=-0.05
{else}
  SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=0.0
{endif}
```

available bed types are:

```c++
"Cool Plate"
"Engineering Plate"
"High Temp Plate"
"Textured PEI Plate"
```
