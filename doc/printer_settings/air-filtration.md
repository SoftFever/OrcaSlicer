# Air Filtration/Exhaust Fan Control in OrcaSlicer

OrcaSlicer use `M106 P3` command to control air-filtration/exhaust fan.

If you are using Klipper, you can define a `M106` macro to control both the normal part cooling fan, auxiliary fan, and exhaust fan.

Below is a reference configuration for Klipper.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to change the pin name to the actual pin name you are using in the configuration.

```ini
# instead of using [fan], we define the default part cooling fan with [fan_generic] here
# this is the default part cooling fan
[fan_generic fan0]
pin: PA7
cycle_time: 0.01
hardware_pwm: false

# this is the auxiliary fan
# comment out it if you don't have auxiliary fan
[fan_generic fan2]
pin: PA8
cycle_time: 0.01
hardware_pwm: false

# this is the exhaust fan
# comment out it if you don't have exhaust fan
[fan_generic fan3]
pin: PA9
cycle_time: 0.01
hardware_pwm: false

[gcode_macro M106]
gcode:
    {% set fan = 'fan' + (params.P|int if params.P is defined else 0)|string %}
    {% set speed = (params.S|float / 255 if params.S is defined else 1.0) %}
    SET_FAN_SPEED FAN={fan} SPEED={speed}
```
