# OrcaSlicer Build Status

## Date: October 12, 2025
## Branch: copilot/vscode1760260866532 (intended to become main)

## System Configuration
- **CPU Cores**: 4
- **RAM**: 15 GB (12 GB available)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (in dev container)
- **Compiler**: GCC 11.4.0
- **Build System**: CMake + Ninja

## Build Progress

### Issue Encountered and Resolved
**Problem**: The initial build attempts failed because `deps/build/CMakeCache.txt` was pointing to the wrong source directory (root `/workspaces/SlicerGPT` instead of `/workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps`). This caused CMake to look for system Boost 1.83.0+ instead of building it from source.

**Solution**: 
1. Completely removed the corrupted `deps/build` directory
2. Reconfigured with explicit paths:
   ```bash
   cmake -S /workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps -B /workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/build \
         -G Ninja \
         -DSLIC3R_PCH=ON \
         -DDESTDIR=/workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/build/destdir \
         -DDEP_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/DL_CACHE \
         -DDEP_WX_GTK3=ON
   ```
3. Started the build with `nohup cmake --build /workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/build`

### Current Status
- **Dependencies Build**: IN PROGRESS (PID: 12820)
- **Log File**: `/tmp/deps_build.log`
- **Estimated Time**: 20-40 minutes for complete dependency build
- **Build Steps**: Approximately 185 dependency build steps total

### Dependencies Being Built
The build process downloads and compiles:
- Boost
- GLFW
- PNG
- TBB (Threading Building Blocks)
- Blosc
- OpenEXR
- GMP
- MPFR
- CGAL
- wxWidgets
- OpenCV
- OpenVDB
- OCCT
- And many others...

## Next Steps

### After Dependencies Complete
Once the dependencies finish building (you can check with `ps -p 12820` or `tail -f /tmp/deps_build.log`):

1. **Build OrcaSlicer itself**:
   ```bash
   ./build_linux.sh -s
   ```

2. **Build with AppImage** (for distribution):
   ```bash
   ./build_linux.sh -si
   ```

3. **Run OrcaSlicer**:
   ```bash
   ./build/src/OrcaSlicer
   ```

### Monitoring Build Progress
- Check if build is running: `ps -p 12820`
- View build log: `tail -f /tmp/deps_build.log`
- Check for errors: `grep -i error /tmp/deps_build.log`
- Check completion: `grep -i "completed" /tmp/deps_build.log | wc -l`

## Build Commands Reference

### System Dependencies (Already Done)
```bash
./build_linux.sh -u
```

### Dependencies Build (Currently Running)
```bash
./build_linux.sh -d
```

### Full Build Sequence (After Dependencies)
```bash
# Just build OrcaSlicer
./build_linux.sh -s

# Or build everything including AppImage
./build_linux.sh -dsi

# With tests
./build_linux.sh -dst
```

### Build Options
- `-1`: Limit to 1 core
- `-j N`: Limit to N cores
- `-b`: Debug mode
- `-c`: Clean build
- `-C`: Colored output
- `-d`: Build dependencies
- `-i`: Build AppImage
- `-p`: Disable precompiled headers
- `-r`: Skip RAM checks
- `-s`: Build OrcaSlicer
- `-t`: Build tests
- `-l`: Use Clang instead of GCC
- `-L`: Use ld.lld linker

## Changes Made to Fix Build

### File Changes
None required - the issue was with the CMake cache state, not the source code.

### Process Changes
1. Cleaned corrupted build directory
2. Used explicit paths in CMake configuration
3. Used `nohup` to run build in background

## Branch Status
This branch (`copilot/vscode1760260866532`) is being prepared to become the main branch. All fixes have been process-related, no source code changes were needed.

## Notes
- The dev container environment is properly configured with all required tools
- System has sufficient resources (4 cores, 15GB RAM) for building
- Build is using system GTK3 development libraries
- Dependencies are being cached in `/workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/DL_CACHE/`
- Build artifacts go to `/workspaces/SlicerGPT/deps/build/destdir/`
