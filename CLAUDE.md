# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

OrcaSlicer is an open-source 3D slicer application forked from Bambu Studio, built using C++ with wxWidgets for the GUI and CMake as the build system. The project uses a modular architecture with separate libraries for core slicing functionality, GUI components, and platform-specific code.

```

### Build System
- Uses CMake with minimum version 3.13 (maximum 3.31.x on Windows)
- Primary build directory: `build/`
- Dependencies are built in `deps/build/`
- The build process is split into dependency building and main application building
- Windows builds use Visual Studio generators
- macOS builds use Xcode by default, Ninja with -x flag
- Linux builds use Ninja generator

### Testing
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use the Catch2 testing framework. Test structure:
- `tests/libslic3r/` - Core library tests (21 test files)
  - Geometry processing, algorithms, file formats (STL, 3MF, AMF)
  - Polygon operations, clipper utilities, Voronoi diagrams
- `tests/fff_print/` - Fused Filament Fabrication tests (12 test files)
  - Slicing algorithms, G-code generation, print mechanics
  - Fill patterns, extrusion, support material
- `tests/sla_print/` - Stereolithography tests (4 test files)
  - SLA-specific printing algorithms, support generation
- `tests/libnest2d/` - 2D nesting algorithm tests
- `tests/slic3rutils/` - Utility function tests
- `tests/sandboxes/` - Experimental/sandbox test code

Run all tests after building:
```bash
cd build && ctest
```

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

Run individual test suites:
```bash
# From build directory
ctest --test-dir ./tests/libslic3r/libslic3r_tests
ctest --test-dir ./tests/fff_print/fff_print_tests
ctest --test-dir ./tests/sla_print/sla_print_tests
# and so on
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Standards
- **C++17 standard** with selective C++20 features
- **Naming conventions**: PascalCase for classes, snake_case for functions/variables
- **Header guards**: Use `#pragma once` 
- **Memory management**: Prefer smart pointers, RAII patterns
- **Thread safety**: Use TBB for parallelization, be mindful of shared state

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding New Print Settings
1. Define setting in `PrintConfig.cpp` with proper bounds and defaults
2. Add UI controls in appropriate GUI components  
3. Update serialization in config save/load
4. Add tooltips and help text for user guidance
5. Test with different printer profiles

#### Modifying Slicing Algorithms  
1. Core algorithms live in `libslic3r/` subdirectories
2. Performance-critical code should be profiled and optimized
3. Consider multi-threading implications (TBB integration)
4. Validate changes don't break existing profiles
5. Add regression tests where appropriate

#### GUI Development
1. GUI code resides in `src/slic3r/GUI/` (not visible in current tree)
2. Use existing wxWidgets patterns and custom controls
3. Support both light and dark themes
4. Consider DPI scaling on high-resolution displays
5. Maintain cross-platform compatibility

#### Adding Printer Support
1. Create JSON profile in `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`
2. Add printer-specific start/end G-code templates
3. Configure build volume, capabilities, and material compatibility
4. Test thoroughly with actual hardware when possible
5. Follow existing profile structure and naming conventions

### Dependencies and Build System
- **CMake-based** with separate dependency building phase
- **Dependencies** built once in `deps/build/`, then linked to main application  
- **Cross-platform** considerations important for all changes
- **Resource files** embedded at build time, platform-specific handling

### Performance Considerations
- **Slicing algorithms** are CPU-intensive, profile before optimizing
- **Memory usage** can be substantial with complex models
- **Multi-threading** extensively used via TBB
- **File I/O** optimized for large 3MF files with embedded textures
- **Real-time preview** requires efficient mesh processing

## Important Development Notes

### Codebase Navigation
- Use search tools extensively - codebase has 500k+ lines
- Key entry points: `src/OrcaSlicer.cpp` for application startup
- Core slicing: `libslic3r/Print.cpp` orchestrates the slicing pipeline
- Configuration: `PrintConfig.cpp` defines all print/printer/material settings

### Compatibility and Stability
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for project files and profiles
- **Cross-platform** support essential (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
- **File format** changes require careful version handling
- **Profile migrations** needed when settings change significantly

### Quality and Testing
- **Regression testing** important due to algorithm complexity
- **Performance benchmarks** help catch performance regressions
- **Memory leak** detection important for long-running GUI application
- **Cross-platform** testing required before releases
