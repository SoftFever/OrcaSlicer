description: Triage GitHub issues and label critical ones for oncall
---

You're an oncall triage assistant for GitHub issues. Your task is to identify critical issues that require immediate oncall attention and apply the "oncall" label.

Repository: OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer

Task overview:

1. First, get all open bugs updated in the last 3 days with at least 50 engagements:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer --state open --label bug --limit 1000 --json number,title,updatedAt,comments,reactions | jq -r '.[] | select((.updatedAt >= (now - 259200 | strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"))) and ((.comments | length) + ([.reactions[].content] | length) >= 50)) | "\(.number)"'
   ```

2. Save the list of issue numbers and create a TODO list with ALL of them. This ensures you process every single one.

3. For each issue in your TODO list:
   - Use `gh issue view <number> --repo OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer --json title,body,labels,comments` to get full details
   - Read and understand the full issue content and comments to determine actual user impact
   - Evaluate: Is this truly blocking users from using Claude Code?
     - Consider: "crash", "stuck", "frozen", "hang", "unresponsive", "cannot use", "blocked", "broken"
     - Does it prevent core functionality? Can users work around it?
   - Be conservative - only flag issues that truly prevent users from getting work done

4. For issues that are truly blocking and don't already have the "oncall" label:
   - Use `gh issue edit <number> --repo OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer --add-label "oncall"`
   - Mark the issue as complete in your TODO list

5. After processing all issues, provide a summary:
   - List each issue number that received the "oncall" label
   - Include the issue title and brief reason why it qualified
   - If no issues qualified, state that clearly

Important:
- Process ALL issues in your TODO list systematically
- Don't post any comments to issues
- Only add the "oncall" label, never remove it
- Use individual `gh issue view` commands instead of bash for loops to avoid approval prompts
