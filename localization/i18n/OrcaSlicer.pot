"2. if the nozzle is worn out or replaced with a new one;\n"
"3. If the max volumetric speed or print temperature is changed in the "
"filament setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "About this calibration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please find the details of Flow Dynamics Calibration from our wiki.\n"
"\n"
"Usually the calibration is unnecessary. When you start a single color/"
"material print, with the \"flow dynamics calibration\" option checked in the "
"print start menu, the printer will follow the old way, calibrate the "
"filament before the print; When you start a multi color/material print, the "
"printer will use the default compensation parameter for the filament during "
"every filament switch which will have a good result in most cases.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that there are a few cases that can make the calibration results "
"unreliable, such as insufficient adhesion on the build plate. Improving "
"adhesion can be achieved by washing the build plate or applying glue. For "
"more information on this topic, please refer to our Wiki.\n"
"\n"
"The calibration results have about 10 percent jitter in our test, which may "
"cause the result not exactly the same in each calibration. We are still "
"investigating the root cause to do improvements with new updates."
msgstr ""

msgid "When to use Flow Rate Calibration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After using Flow Dynamics Calibration, there might still be some extrusion "
"issues, such as:\n"
"1. Over-Extrusion: Excess material on your printed object, forming blobs or "
"zits, or the layers seem thicker than expected and not uniform.\n"
"2. Under-Extrusion: Very thin layers, weak infill strength, or gaps in the "
"top layer of the model, even when printing slowly.\n"
"3. Poor Surface Quality: The surface of your prints seems rough or uneven.\n"
"4. Weak Structural Integrity: Prints break easily or don't seem as sturdy as "
"they should be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, Flow Rate Calibration is crucial for foaming materials like LW-"
"PLA used in RC planes. These materials expand greatly when heated, and "
"calibration provides a useful reference flow rate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Flow Rate Calibration measures the ratio of expected to actual extrusion "
"volumes. The default setting works well in Bambu Lab printers and official "
"filaments as they were pre-calibrated and fine-tuned. For a regular "
"filament, you usually won't need to perform a Flow Rate Calibration unless "
"you still see the listed defects after you have done other calibrations. For "
"more details, please check out the wiki article."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Auto Flow Rate Calibration utilizes Bambu Lab's Micro-Lidar technology, "
"directly measuring the calibration patterns. However, please be advised that "
"the efficacy and accuracy of this method may be compromised with specific "
"types of materials. Particularly, filaments that are transparent or semi-"
"transparent, sparkling-particled, or have a high-reflective finish may not "
"be suitable for this calibration and can produce less-than-desirable "
"results.\n"
"\n"
"The calibration results may vary between each calibration or filament. We "
"are still improving the accuracy and compatibility of this calibration "
"through firmware updates over time.\n"
"\n"
"Caution: Flow Rate Calibration is an advanced process, to be attempted only "
"by those who fully understand its purpose and implications. Incorrect usage "
"can lead to sub-par prints or printer damage. Please make sure to carefully "
"read and understand the process before doing it."
